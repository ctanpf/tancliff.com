Welcome to My Website Repo

This is a project to update my existing bio website. *(check my github for that !)*

I'm currently planning to move everything to Jekyll and Markdown and ~~*rumor says that Jekyll is so much better*~~ I am currently going through some documentations and things are going pretty smooth *at least for now*
